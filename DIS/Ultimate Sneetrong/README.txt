Thanks for reading me.

Since you are reading this, you at least have your Github account set up and invited to this repo.
Try reading this offline by pulling the project through Git.
You need git installed and you'll want files to put all this stuff in.
Use the guide I sent you on discord to pull the repo into a folder of your choosing (if you are using a command prompt thing, type "cd <filename or full path>" to change where it's running from/will put the files)
Once you have it on your computer. change this or the main.py file and commit the changes.
then push the changes to the remote repo (the Github webpage)
then you can check to see if it's there.

Git is the bottom line most important bit, because you can still edit the .py with a text editor or upload sprites via github.
