Thanks for reading me.

Since you are reading this, you at least have your Github account set up and invited to this repo.
Try reading this offline by pulling the project through Git.
You need git installed and you'll want files to put all this stuff in.
Use the guide I sent you on discord to pull the repo into a folder of your choosing (if you are using a command prompt thing, type "cd <filename or full path>" to change where it's running from/will put the files)
Once you have it on your computer. change this or the main.py file and commit the changes.
then push the changes to the remote repo (the Github webpage)
then you can check to see if it's there.

Git is the bottom line most important bit, because you can still edit the .py with a text editor or upload sprites via github.

This'll be important for every coding project.

for this one, however, I have decided we'll start simple with Python/Pygame to make Sneetrong

This means you will need to install python to run and effectively edit the game's code.
https://www.python.org/downloads/
grab the latest version (3.8.5)
when you run the installer, kinda hidden at the bottom is an unchecked box that asks if you want to add python 2.8 to the PATH. Check t
If everything is done right you should be able to type "python3" into the command prompt and it will respond with the version and some info about python


Once you have python installed, you can install Pygame. Pygame is just a chunk of code that will manage screens and inputs for us.
us this https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted for further instructions. it mentions "Pip" which is automatically built in don't worry.

Lastly, you will want an IDE(Interactive Development Environment), a program to help you program essentially.
One comes with the java installation called "IDLE". Just search for it in the start menu/cortana thing.
It's kinda barebones though. I will use and strongly recommend PyCharm. The community edition is free and more than we'll ever need.
The main reasons I like it are A) dark mode/theme. and B) manages github stuff for you pretty easily. (might be a little funky to set up though, scream out for help if wanted)
